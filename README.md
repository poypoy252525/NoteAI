# NoteAI - AI-Powered Note Taking Application

NoteAI is a sophisticated full-stack note-taking application that goes beyond traditional note-taking by integrating artificial intelligence to enhance organization, search, and content creation.

## üöÄ Overview

NoteAI combines the power of modern web technologies with AI capabilities to create an intelligent note-taking experience. Unlike generic note apps, NoteAI leverages semantic search, rich text editing, and LLM integration to help users manage and discover their knowledge more effectively.

## üß† Key Features

### AI-Powered Semantic Search

- **Intelligent Note Discovery**: Find notes based on meaning and context, not just keywords
- **Similar Notes Suggestions**: Automatically discover related content using embedding-based similarity
- **Natural Language Queries**: Search using conversational language rather than specific terms

### Rich Text Editing

- **Comprehensive Editor**: Full-featured rich text editor with formatting, lists, tables, and more
- **Content Organization**: Support for headings, lists, tables, code blocks, and multimedia
- **Real-time Preview**: WYSIWYG editing experience with live content preview

### Intelligent Features

- **AI-Powered Insights**: LLM integration for content enhancement and suggestions
- **Smart Summarization**: Automatic note summarization for quick overviews
- **Content Generation**: AI assistance for expanding and improving notes

### User Management

- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure session management
- **Personal Notes**: Private note storage with user isolation
- **Profile Management**: User profile and preferences customization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend

- **React 19** with TypeScript for modern UI development
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **TailwindCSS** with **shadcn/ui** for beautiful, accessible components
- **React Router v7** for client-side routing
- **Zustand** for state management

### Backend

- **Express.js v5** with TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma ORM** for data persistence
- **JWT** for secure authentication
- **Google Generative AI** and **Ollama** for LLM capabilities
- **Vercel** for seamless deployment

### AI Integration

- **Semantic Search**: Embedding-based note similarity and search
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with both cloud (Google GenAI) and local (Ollama) models
- **Content Processing**: AI-powered content analysis and enhancement

## üîß How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users create, edit, and organize notes through the React frontend
2. **Content Processing**: Notes are processed by the backend for storage and AI analysis
3. **Embedding Generation**: Content is converted to embeddings for semantic search capabilities
4. **AI Enhancement**: LLMs provide insights, summaries, and content suggestions
5. **Intelligent Retrieval**: Users can find notes through semantic search and similarity matching

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**: Secure account creation with password hashing
2. **JWT Tokens**: Token-based authentication for API access
3. **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based session handling
4. **Protected Routes**: Role-based access control for note management

### Search Architecture

1. **Traditional Search**: Keyword-based filtering and matching
2. **Semantic Search**: Embedding-based similarity for contextual matching
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both methods for comprehensive results
4. **Real-time Indexing**: Notes are indexed for search as they're created/updated
